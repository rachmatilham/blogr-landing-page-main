- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://react.dev/) - JS library
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS framework
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - Frontend build tooling

### What I learned

In this project, I learn to use array map for mapping the data to the nav and footer components. I also learn to use state as a toggle to make an accordion nav link lists.

### Continued development

Minor adjustment can be done to improve the background pattern position and size.
